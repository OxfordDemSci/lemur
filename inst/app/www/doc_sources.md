## Data sources
---

The Life Expectancy Monitoring Tool uses data from public databases available at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME 2021) and the United Nations World Population Prospects (United Nations 2019).

The age- and cause-specific number of deaths as well as life tables were obtained from the IHME, which estimates the death counts attributable to each cause of death (this is our base source for all the calculations on cause reduce mortality). Similarly, the United Nations World Population Prospects involves statistical estimations using survey and census to account for the paucity of registration data in those areas (aggregate values of population counts, total fertility rate, population growth and life expectancies were obtained from this source and which appear in the maps). 

Our results based on IHME and UN data are estimates before Covid-19, so survival is very likely to be overestimated. 

Despite the IHME and UN data limitations, these source provide consistent global comparability over a long time to uncover the past and current trends in many low-income countries.
