Description: The life expectancy monitoring tool allows the user to selected 
  mortality changes over the entire lifespan or at specific ages, as well as 
  for overall mortality or for specific causes of death. For example, how 
  would life expectancy look if cardiovascular mortality were to be reduced 
  by 50%? Or how would life expectancy look if infant mortality was eliminated? 
  The tool facilitates assessing changes and comparisons in life expectancy 
  under those selected scenarios of mortality change. Furthermore, the tool 
  lets the user compare cause-of-death profiles and life expectancies across 
  time, countries and sexes.
